# A simple shopping cart demo app

Built a simple app with Laravel and Stimulus.js, plus Tailwind CSS with JIT mode.

## Setups

-   Run `npm install @hotwired/stimulus @hotwired/stimulus-webpack-helpers` to install Stimulus.js and helper packages.
-   Check out [Stimulus.js Handbook](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/installing) to setup configurations.
-   Run `php artisan serve` to launch this app, also run `npm run hot` to build and hot reload the assets, I mean those bundled CSS and JavaScript files.
